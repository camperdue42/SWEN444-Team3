# Install React and project depependencies

npm install

# Host the web app locally

npm start

# View the website

The previous command should have launched a new tab in your browser to bring you directly to the calendar page of the app.
If this is not the case, open your browser and navigate to the page "localhost:3000".

# Notes
This is a working prototype meant to show off design, so most of the backend (saving journal entries, matching with other users for chats) is non-functional. In the calendar view, the colors of each day are randomized to simulate what user entries would look like, as well as the modal that appears when a day is selected.
